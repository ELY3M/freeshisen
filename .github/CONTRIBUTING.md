# Contributing
## All contributions are welcome!

Currently, this project is done by me, @knilch0r, whenever I find some time -- and unfortunately, that's not very often.

So I'm very fond of contributions, and the more constructive they are, the better.

* send me pull requests. try to align the code to the coding style you see in the existing parts.
* if you're not able to write code, but like to see something change, create an issue using the github issue tracker. try
  to explain your environment, the behavior you've seen and the behavior you'd liked instead.
