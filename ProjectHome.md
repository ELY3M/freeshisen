Project's goal is to implement a free, open-source [Shisen Sho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shisen_sho) game for Android. Aim is to not use any extra permissions on your android device and to not display any ads at runtime :-)

This is basically a fork of the already existing excellent implementation from "proofofconcept" which is available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.proofofconcept.shisensho

Additions:
  * saveable preferences
  * adapted layout for big screens (e.g. tablets)
  * highscores
  * using Google Code hosting instead of dropbox ;-)
