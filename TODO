TODO list for FreeShisen:

* ask for acknowledge before resetting a game (e.g. when settings were changed)

* provide higher resolution tilesets (the scaled ones look rather ugly)
** could use current SVGs from libkmahjongg as a basis
** do this depending on display density?

* allow to choose tilesets (libkmahjongg has several) ;-)

* i18n (lots of!)
** remove some lefover hardcoded strings
** add i18n variants for resources

* use actionbar? this will cost some display space, but apparently is the new way to go
** then we don't have to claim targetSdkVersion 10 any more (which provides a software menu button for devices without a hardware button)
** may also think of another way to provide some "software menu" button

* save highscores depending on gravity switch?

* ask for name in highscore list?
