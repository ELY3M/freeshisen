TODO list for FreeShisen:

* provide a new icon

* provide scalable tilesets (the scaled ones look rather ugly)
** could use current SVGs from libkmahjongg as a basis
** try to use svg-android (needs SVG Basic 1.1 as format, however...)

* i18n (lots of!)
** remove some leftover hardcoded strings
** add i18n variants for resources

* save highscores depending on gravity switch?

* ask for name in highscore list?

* add sound effects

* add music

* add counters for all kinds of events (may supersede current hiscore implementation)
** time played, games won/lost, average times, etc

* add "achievements" based on counters
